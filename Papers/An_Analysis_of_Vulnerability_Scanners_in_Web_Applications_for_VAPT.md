### Goal: focus on various vulnerability analysis tools forming basis for VAPT for short and try to analyze the various impact with respect to stages of penetration testing. (techniques)

Goal 1: Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing techniques

	Vulnerability Assessment: "seeks information about vulnerabilities in known packages and software"

	Penetration Testing: " tries to exploit weakness in structure or environment"
	
Goal 2: Highlight some of the general issues which can be encountered by using some of the open-source tools only

### Additional Notes
**Zones:**
- [External](#external-zone): connected to external network
- Demilitarized zone: web servers
- [Internal](#internal-zone)

## Approach

### Vulnerability Analysis Phases:
- [Discover](#discover): determine scope and testing activities
- [Access](#access): gain knowledge by using tools
- [Reporting](#reporting): Compliance & Remediation
- [Remediation](#remediation): strategies (accept, mitigate, transfer)
- [Verify](#verify): check remediation is successful

### Penetration Testing Phases:
- Agreement
- Planning & Reconnaissance: locating targets and methods for attack
- Scanning: perform attack and record responses
- Gaining Access: includes persistance
- Retaining Access
- Exploitation: locating targets and methods for attack
- Evidence and Reporting: locating targets and methods for attack

<br>

<a id="solutions"></a>
## Solutions

Intruders are now using **automated structures** in form of BOTS, AI, ML, to perform these attacks.   

<br>

<a id="tools"></a>
## Tools

- **ZapBurp** (vuln. scan and mitigation measures)  
- **netcraft** (hosting/network details and background)
- **Whois** (websites, IP owner info)
- [Zenmap](#zenmap)
- [Maltego](#maltego)

<br>

<a id="Methods"></a>
## Methods (ex: Raspberry Pi)  

<br> 

<a id="terminology"></a>
## Terminology

**Vulnerability:** security flaws in a system's architecture
  
<br>

----

## Misc

<a id="discover"></a>
**Discover (Vuln. Analysis Phase):**

	- goal and objectives
	- assets, information flow
	- determine scope and form basic penetration testing activities

<br>

<a id="access"></a>
**Access (Vuln. Analysis Phase):**

	- Testing using Tools, knowledge about infrastructure
	- tools can be host, network, database, and application based (e.g. ZAP and Burp)
	- Perform automated scan of target 
		- Black Box (no access to target)
		- White Box (authorized access to whole infrastructure and code
		- Grey Box (limitied access to resources)

<br>

<a id="reporting"></a>
**Reporting (Vuln. Analysis Phase):**

	- Compliance (e.g. OWASP and ISO) & Remediation
<br>

<a id="remediation"></a>
**Remediation (Vuln. Analysis Phase):**

	- Strategies: 
		- Accept (if cost parameters or high exploitability)
		- [Mitigate](#mitigate): attempt to remove vuln. within system
		- Transfer (transfer to 3rd party or other internal party)
<br>

<a id="verify"></a>
**Verify (Vuln. Analysis Phase):**

	- Above step was sucessful
	- Important feedback  

<br>

<a id="mitigate"></a>
**(Remediation Strategy) Mitigate:**

	**Def: attempt to remove vuln. within system

	- Fix vulnerablity with patch level update or upgrading version  

<br>

<a id="planning-reconnaissance"></a>
**(Pen Testing Phase) Planning and Reconnaissance:**

Collect information:
- Physical location of target
- Data OS, hardware configuration
- Services, Phone list
- Sniffing
- Extraction through social engineering (include Impersonation, intrusion reverse social Engineering), Dumpster Diving internet foot printing, search Engines)

Tools:
- netcraft (hosting/network details and background)
- Whois (websites, IP owner info)
- [Zenmap](#zenmap)
- [Maltego](#maltego)

<br>

<a id="zenmap"></a>
**Zenmap (Tool):**

More refined than Nmap

Uses UI features for Nmap

Useful for gaining info in terms of Network Exploitation and open ports (e.g. Host details)

Defined in this paper for Reconnaissance and planning

Uses:
- Operating system and version
- list of open ports
- services
- Monitoring
- Network inventory kind of tasks

<br>

<a id="maltego"></a>
**Maltego (Tool):**

Main: used to exploit using email (identified for Reconnaissance and planning)

- open source and commercial
- uses OSINT and graphical link analysis (for connection related information)
- available on Windows, Linux, etc
- efficient against connected information (e.g. email and phone numbers)

<br>

<a id="external-zone"></a>
**External Zones:**

	connected to external network

	Exploitable Vulnerabilities:
	- firewall misconfiguration
	- usage of outdated components  
  
<br>

<a id="internal-zone"></a>
**Internal Zones:**

	Exploits:
	- Social engineering
	- Computer worms
	- Insider attack
