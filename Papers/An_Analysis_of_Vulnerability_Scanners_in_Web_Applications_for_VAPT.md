## Main Topics: (State of the Art)

### Approach

<u>**Phases**</u>

**Discover**
* goal and objectives
* assets, information flow

**Access**
* Testing using Tools, knowledge about infrastructure
* tools can be host, network, database, and application based

**Reporting**
* Compliance & Remediation

**Remediation
* strategies Accept, Mitigate, Transfer

**Verify**
* above step was sucessful


### Solutions

Intruders are now using **automated structures** in form of BOTS, AI, ML, to perform these attacks. 


### Tools


	
### Methods (ex: Raspberry Pi)


### Terminology

Vulnerability: security flaws in a system's architecture


### Misc

#### (Zones) External
connected to external network

Exploitable Vulnerabilities:
* firewall misconfiguration
* usage of outdated components

#### (Zones) Internal

Exploits:
* Social engineering
* Computer worms
* Insider attack

#### (Term) Discover
determine scope and form basic penetration testing activities

#### (Term) Access
use tools (e.g. ZAP and Burp)
Perform automated scan of target (Black Box, White Box, Grey Box)
