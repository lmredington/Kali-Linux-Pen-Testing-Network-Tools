### Goal: focus on various vulnerability analysis tools forming basis for VAPT for short and try to analyze the various impact with respect to stages of penetration testing. (techniques)

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
	
#### Zones:
* [External](#external-zone): connected to external network
* Demilitarized zone: web servers
* [Internal](#internal-zone)  

<a id="external-zone"></a>
**External(Zones)**
connected to external network

Exploitable Vulnerabilities:
* firewall misconfiguration
* usage of outdated components  

<a id="internal-zone"></a>
**Internal(Zones)**

Exploits:
* Social engineering
* Computer worms
* Insider attack  

<a id="approach"></a>
## Approach

**Vulnerability Analysis Phases:**

* [Discover](#discover)
* [Access](#access)
* [Reporting](#reporting)
* [Remediation](#remediation)
* [Verify](#verify)

<a id="discover"></a>
#### (Phase) Discover
* goal and objectives
* assets, information flow
* determine scope and form basic penetration testing activities

<a id="access"></a>
#### (Phase) Access
* Testing using Tools, knowledge about infrastructure
* tools can be host, network, database, and application based (e.g. ZAP and Burp)
* Perform automated scan of target 
	* Black Box (no access to target)
	* White Box (authorized access to whole infrastructure and code
	* Grey Box (limitied access to resources)

<a id="reporting"></a>
#### (Phase) Reporting

Compliance (e.g. OWASP and ISO) & Remediation

<a id="remediation"></a>
#### (Phase) Remediation

strategies: 
* Accept (if cost parameters or high exploitability)
* [Mitigate](#mitigate)
* Transfer (transfer to 3rd party or other internal party)

<a id="verify"></a>
#### (Phase) Verify

above step was sucessful

Important feedback  

**Penetration Testing Phases**
* Agreement
* Planning and Reconnaissance (locating targets and methods for attack)
* Scanning (perform attack and record responses)
* Gaining Access (includes persistance)
* Retaining Access
* Exploitation (locating targets and methods for attack)
* Evidence and Reporting (locating targets and methods for attack)  


<a id="solutions"></a>
## Solutions

Intruders are now using **automated structures** in form of BOTS, AI, ML, to perform these attacks.   

<a id="tools"></a>
## Tools

* ZapBurp (vuln. scan and mitigation measures)  

<a id="Methods"></a>
## Methods (ex: Raspberry Pi)  

<a id="terminology"></a>
## Terminology

Vulnerability: security flaws in a system's architecture
  

## Misc

<a id="mitigate"></a>
#### (Remediation Strategy) Mitigate

Def: attempt to remove vuln. within system

Fix vulnerablity with patch level update or upgrading version

<a id="planning-reconnaissance"></a>
#### (Pen Testing Phase) Planning and Reconnaissance

Collect information:
* Physical location of target
* Data OS, hardware configuration
* Services, Phone list
* Sniffing
* Extraction through social engineering (include Impersonation, intrusion reverse social Engineering), Dumpster Diving internet foot printing, search Engines)

Tools:
* netcraft (hosting/network details and background)
* Whois (websites, IP owner info)
* [Zenmap](#zenmap)
* [Maltego](#maltego)

<a id="zenmap"></a>
#### (Tool) Zenmap

Uses:
* Operating system and version
* list of open ports
* services
* Monitoring
* Network inventory kind of tasks

More refined than Nmap

Uses UI features for Nmap

Useful for gaining info in terms of Network Exploitation and open ports (e.g. Host details)

<a id="maltego"></a>
#### (Tool) Maltego

Main: used to exploit using email

* open source and commercial
* uses OSINT and graphical link analysis (for connection related information)
* available on Windows, Linux, etc
* efficient against connected information (e.g. email and phone numbers)
