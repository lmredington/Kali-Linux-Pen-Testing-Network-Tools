### Goal: Open-Source usercustomizable OSINT and Web Vulnerability scanner in Python environment scripts
	
	
## Main Topics: (State of the Art)

### New approaches


### Solutions
The idea is to develop an 
* Open-Source usercustomizable OSINT and Web Vulnerability scanner
* in Python environment scripts 
* very transparent on the algorithm for performing OSINT search or Web Vulnerability scanning. 
* This feature is a nightmare for any pen-tester to test or track on their target endpoints using open-source that is highly transparent in scanning ports and functions that they trust on.
*  The tools for open-source intelligence related activities, and web vulnerability scanning as a user-customizable platform gives a pen-tester enormous activities perform and to trust its process without any harm of their targets.

**pen-tester to work ethically**
	customizing the type and parameter he wants to scan instead of going unethical in an online 3rd party service provider
	
	Action of adding unethical scripts into the python environment will be a bad result for the pen-tester itself, because of the highly transparent Open-source plugins we have added along with the package installation setup.

**Reduce Footprint
	There was a high need of having an open-source customizable OSINT and web vulnerabilities scanner so that the pen-testers can work on their stages oftesting without worrying about the footprints and the type of parameters that may run in the backend for 3rd party service providers.



### Tools

#### Traditional:
* Burp Suite
* Nmap
* Shodan

#### New:
**OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)**
* identify and target relevant data sources based on the specific requirements of the user
* targets: websites, social media platforms, public databases, government records, online forums, blogs, and more
* Practices:
	* Getting the online presence of the target
	* Social media activity and log monitoring
	* Contacts mentioned anywhere
	* Links and connection of networks
	* Recently accomplished work
	* Involved in any social activities via medias or publications

	
### Methods (ex: Raspberry Pi)


### Misc
**Web Vulnerability**
* Stage 2 of penetration testing phase
* Scanning practices: clickjacking, host header injection, subdomain enumeration and reverse IP

**Penetration Testing**
* tools:  Burp Suite, Nmap, Shodan etc
