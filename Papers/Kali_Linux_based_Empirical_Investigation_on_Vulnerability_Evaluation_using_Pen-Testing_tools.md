### Goal: 
	
	
## Main Topics: (State of the Art)

### New approaches

Should be adjusted to the individual demands of the testing engagement, considering the target system or network, the customer's needs, and the testing team's resource. 

**Phases:**
(1) Pre-engagement Interactions (prep-stage)
(2) Information Gathering
(3) Vulnerabilities analysis (scanning stage)
(4) Vulnerability exploitation (how deep within system to still discover targets)
(5) Post exploitation (intrusion complete, stay in machine without detection)
(6) Report Generation (methodology report)


### Solutions


### Tools (for reconnaissance and planning)
* Wapiti (Web-app script flaws)
* Skipfish (current web application security reconnaissance tool)
* Arachni
* Nessus (network security scanner)
* w3af (finding and using web application vulnerabilities)
* Acunetix (weak passwords, XSS, along with SQL injection)
* Web Security (list in Table 1)
* Nmap (port scanner)
		
### Methods (ex: Raspberry Pi)
* OSs:
	* Kali Linux
	* BlackArch
	* BackBox
	* Parrot Security OS
	* Pentoo i
	* WHAX is a Slackware-based operating system

### Misc

#### (OS) Kali Linux

* Utilities and tools preinstalled
* good for: vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, digital forensics, and network analysis
* tools are divided into several areas: Information Collecting, Password Attacks, Web Applications, Wireless Attacks, and Exploitation Tools. 
* Used by cybersecurity experts and researchers and ethical hackers

#### (Tool) Wapiti
* web-app security
* performs black box based scans
* becomes a fuzzer after acquiring source code issues, adding payloads to look for script flaws. 

#### (Tool) Arachni
* can handle attack/input vectors that non-humans would not normally be able to detect
* audited server's responsiveness and your bandwidth will be your only limitations
* asynchronous HTTP technique contributes to its exceptional performance (courtesy of Typhoeus)

#### (Tool) Nessus
*  network security scanner tool
* simple - Plug-in install
* Great all-purpose tool:
* Scan Windows and Unix systems, so you may scan a variety of areas in a single session

#### (Phase) Vulnerabilities analysis
* network or machines is inspected for vulnerabilities
* tester evaluates the vulnerabilities
* judge factors (ex: OS, particular service version, firewall service, or port #)
