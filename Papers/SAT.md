### Goal: Evaluate publicly available web vulnerability scanners and propose an Integrated Multi-Agent Blackbox Security Assessment Tool (SAT)

**Goal 1:** Evaluation of publicly available web vulnerability scanners is performed against the top ten OWASP vulnerabilities and their performance is measured on the precision of their results

**Goal 2:** Proposed an Integrated Multi-Agent Blackbox Security Assessment Tool (SAT) for the security assessment of web applications


<br>
### Additional Notes

Changes in configuration settings are adequate to affix only 17% of vulnerabilities, most of those have a low severity level. 

On average, 33 vulnerabilities are found in each web application, among 6 of those are of high severity.

Examples of attacks: CSS, SQLi, remote code execution, file inclusion, XSS
