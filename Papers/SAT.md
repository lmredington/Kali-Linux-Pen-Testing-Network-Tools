### Goal: Evaluate publicly available web vulnerability scanners and propose an Integrated Multi-Agent Blackbox Security Assessment Tool (SAT)

**Goal 1:** Evaluation of publicly available web vulnerability scanners is performed against the top ten OWASP vulnerabilities and their performance is measured on the precision of their results

**Goal 2:** Proposed an Integrated Multi-Agent Blackbox Security Assessment Tool (SAT) for the security assessment of web applications


<br>
### Additional Notes

Changes in configuration settings are adequate to affix only 17% of vulnerabilities, most of those have a low severity level. 

On average, 33 vulnerabilities are found in each web application, among 6 of those are of high severity.

Examples of attacks: CSS, SQLi, remote code execution, file inclusion, XSS

Automated tools have to check every possible flaw in web app

Access Control flaws, hardcoded back-door, and identification of multi cover attack is **difficult** to detect and **harder** to detect with these tools

**Tool Assessment Parameters**
- [Quality of Crawling (QoC)](#qoc)
- [Quality of Fuzzing (QoF)](#qof)
- **Quality of Analyzing (QoA)**

**Precision Rate:** percentage of correctly detected vulnerabilities

<a id="approach"></a>
## Approach
* Black-box
	- higher possibility scanner generates falsify detected vulnerabilities
	
### SAT

**Process Initiator (PI)**
	
	Def: User input targeted URL in this module.
	
	Use:  host discovery and initialization of the scanning process
	
	Additional:
	
		Unreachable hosts are screened here and further process is terminated
	
**Security Assessment Unit (SAU)**
	
	Def: performs scanning of the input web application
	
	Subsections: 
	- Scanning Engine
		- In mutual compliance with Zap, Nikto, and W3af
		- Uses Arachni Crawler and provides features for costom plugin scripts like OAuth, etc.
	- Vulnerabilities database: contains a list of all possible vulnerabilities of OWASP top 10
	- Knowledgebase
		- AI (Artificial Intelligence) based analysis engine
		- responsible to identify security trends, Information leakage and highlight compromised critical data of scanned organizations.
