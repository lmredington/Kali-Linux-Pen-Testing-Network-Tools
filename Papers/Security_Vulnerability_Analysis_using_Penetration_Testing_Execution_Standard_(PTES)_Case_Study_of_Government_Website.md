### Goal: Testing utilized Kali Linux and tools (ex: OWASP ZAP, Acunetix, Nmap, Paros, and others); Uses nslookup - provides information about the server and address information of the XYZ regional government website

**Goal 1:** 

**Goal 2:** 

<br>

### Additional Notes

**Real Life Attacks**

	Trojan attacks
		- 56% of all attacks
		
	Information Gathering Attacks
		- 43%
		
	Web Application Attacks
		- 1%

<br>
		
**System:** 
	
	Def: collection of interrelated and organized elements that collaborate to perform a specific function and achieve a common objective
	
	Elements: 
		- System boundaries
		- System components
		- External environment
		- System interfaces
		- System inputs
		- System outputs
		- System processing
		- System objectives
		
<br>

**Information:** 
	
	Def: set of processed data that is relevant and meaningful to the receiver in reducing uncertainties when making decisions
	
	Information system composed of:
		- Hardware
		- Software
		- Communication networks
		- Data sources
		- People (gather, transform, and distribute information)
		
**Assets:**
- Hardware
- Software
- Telecommunications infrastructure
- Services
- Personnel
- Applications

<br>

**Threats to Info Systems:**

	(1) Active: malicous activities
		
		Ex: data theft, unauthorized system usage, illegal destruction, and unauthorized modification
		
	(2) Passive: non-malicous events
	
		Ex: system failures, human errors, and natural disasters
