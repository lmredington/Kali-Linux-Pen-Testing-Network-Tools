**Thingful was a search engine for the Internet of Things, providing a unique geographical index of real-time data from connected objects around the world, including energy, radiation, weather, and air quality devices as well as seismographs, iBeacons, ships, aircraft and even animal trackers.**

**Note!!**
	
	Thingful was created by Umbrellium before being spun out in 2014 into a separate company led by Usman Haque, Sam Mulube, Andrew Caleya Chetty and Dot Samsen and eventually sunsetted in 2022.


## Description 
Indexed thousands of IoT platforms, infrastructures and resources, enabling people to search and find devices, datasets and realtime data sources by geolocation. Millions of connected objects & sensors across the planet generate real-time open data. Thingful's Datapipes made it quick and easy to find and use open IoT data.

## Examples of Thingful in use included:

* London's first autonomous vehicle pilot
* using machine learning to fill in missing dat
* finding & acquiring real-time urban IoT data from across the data spectrum
* London's first autonomous vehicle pilot
* real-time data permissions management for connected car infrastructure â€“ make data securely available to 3rd parties
* We were part of the authoring team on British Standard PAS 212 / Hypercat - Automatic Resource Discovery for the Internet of Things
* IoT data visualisation and experimentation platform for Singapore's National Institute of Education (NIE), enabling staff and students to gather, analyse and process open IoT data from around the world


## Uses:

Find out about any air quality monitors in your neighbourhood; somebody working with a Raspberry Pi can find others round the corner using the same computing platform

if you notice a ship moored nearby, discover more about it by tracking it on Thingful, or get notified of its movements; 

a citizen concerned about flooding in a new neighbourhood can look up nearby flood monitors or **find others** that have been measuring radiation. 

You might even watch the weekly movements of a shark as it explores the oceans.
